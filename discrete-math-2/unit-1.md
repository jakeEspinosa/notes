# Unit 1
## Psuedocode Syntax
for-loops use the following syntax: `for index in start to finish`

## Algorithmic Complexity
Best-case: minimum number of ops
Worst-case: max number of ops
Asymptotic growth === big O
- Drop constants and smaller n's because they are dominated by the higher order ones
    - Likewise, exponential time is denoted as 2^n because the base doesn't matter

### Theta, Omega, and O
Big O: worst case
Big Theta: average
Big Omega: best

You can compare complexities where a fast algo is the same as a slow one, but *not* vice-versa
