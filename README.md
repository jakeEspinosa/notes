# Notes
This repo houses my notes on various topics, from programming languages to personal productivity.
I firmly believe that hand writing and then digitizing notes is one of the best ways to learn. Your
brain processes the same information using different modalities (reading, hand writing, typing), 
and thus activates different neurons. 

While my aim with this isn't to provide useful information to others, I hope the content or at least my
approach provides value. If this encourages even one person to hand write notes, I consider it a success!
